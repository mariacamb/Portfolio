    <div class="THEMES">

        <h1> BASIC WEB DESIGN</h1>
        <p> First weeks at KEA were all about basic web design. HTML and CSS became the everyday thing, by means of prototypes, moodboards and styletiles, step by step we got closer to the layout of our very first website. <br> Fifth week into semester, there was a challenging task- make that website responsive. The initially only mobile version got its desktop version as well. <br> "Closing" project of the Basic webdesign theme was a group assignment. The task was to redesign existing website, by creating a new layout while trying to stick to company's values.<br> By clicking on icons on the left side, you can take a look on both websites and the presentation for the second assignment.


        </p>
        <h2> BASIC ANIMATION</h2>

        <p1>Within this theme we got in contact with JavaScript for the first time in semester (or for me, first time ever). We were taught how to use it in order to make our selfdrawn characters move, how to add sound and much more. <br> The assignment Simple Animation contains optional amount of different simple animations (minimum requirement is 10). By clicking on the button, you can make Batman fly, jump, disappear,glow, just try!<br> Character design was a truly inspirational, funny and above all creative, yet demanding process. It took a day or two to come up with an unique creature, its traits, personality and also, the short story (as you can see in the document Worksheet). Adobe Illustrator became the main tool to bring this task to life. <br> When we created a platform we could build our story on, the task was to make our character walk, seen in Sprite Sheet animation.<br>Next on the schedule was Interactive animation. The assignment was meant to be worked on in pairs. Me and my teammate chose her little evil character to make it go to Disco Inferno.<br> ProjectPool days 1 and 2 were about using HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create one project a day, in pairs. First one is an animated menu and a second one is a simple calculator, both can come handy to use.<br> Icons on the left side represent tasks in order mentioned above.

        <h3>BASIC UX</h3>
        <p2>The four-weeks long project within this theme was not only the one taking the biggest amount of time but was also the most broad and complex assignment we have been working on this semester. Focusing on users and their needs, our task was to bring a new, original product or service on the market, having considered aspects of business, marketing, finance, technology as well as qualities such as trustworthness, usability, effectivity, simplicity... <br> Very helpful and fun way to "go deep" in thinking about the business idea was to create the <a target="blank" href="businessmodelcanvas.png"> Business Model Canvas</a><br>Mission, vision, values of our company can be seen in
            <a target="blank" href="reKreate_report.pdf"> The Report </a>and the whole design process that went hand in hand with mentioned elements is described in<a target="_blank" href="reKreate_design-documentation.pdf"> Design Documentation.</a><br> Click on the icons and take a look on the website of our company and our final pitch!
        </p2>

        <h4> BASIC VIDEO</h4>
        <p3> Narration without words, video grammer and sound were the last topics of the semester. We got to know another Adobe programme, Premiere Pro CC. First week assignment was to shoot a short video, using no words within a topic we could choose from three assigned options. The result is our video "Too busy?"<br> The final project was a City Walk and Meetup which we had a great fun making. First, the idea got its realistic features thanks to creating a<a target="_blank" href="Story%20board%20-%20%20City%20walk%20and%20meetup.pdf"> Storyboard </a> and then, you can see how well we managed to make it happen in our Copenhagen Dare.
        </p3>

        <h5> INTERACTIVE TEASER (group project) </h5>
        <p4>The last assignment of the theme was to make an interactive teaser which was to be presented for the group of students. Each group was assigned with a different black and white movie, same requirements but at the same time lots space for own imagination and creativity to deal with the task. First things first, to get to know our target audience, we've done a research on their interests, hobbies, values etc. which resulted in Personas collage. In order to get more detailed overiew of how we want our teaser to look, what should each scene contain, how long it is supposed to last and such, we created the Storyboard of the future teaser. Then, we got to have our idea tested, so another step was conducting an Expert test, which summary you can see<a target="blank" href="summary_experttest.pdf">
            here. </a><br> The result of how it all fell into pieces is to be seen by clicking on the icon number three.
